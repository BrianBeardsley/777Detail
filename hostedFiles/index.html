								<p class="aboutDesc">Hi, Im George and Im the founder and owner of 777 Detailing. I started 777 back in 2002 with one objective, to educate car enthusiast about great ways to clean, maintain, and protect their beautiful cars. Detailing started off as a peaceful way to enjoy my time away from work and I soon realized that I could serve my community by sharing what I enjoy doing with others. 777 was born and I've never looked back! Detailing has introduced me to so many wonderful clients and allowed me to work with some amazing cars, I look forward for the years to come and what 777 brings next.</a>.</p>

								<p class="aboutDesc">I've always had a love for a fresh clean look on a beautiful vehicle. Detailing has been a part of my life since I was a young man and I've always enjoyed giving my cars that fresh look. I joined George and 777 in 2008 and help our clients guiding the exterior wrapping, window tinting and glass replacement processes. I enjoy creating customized exterior wraps that our clients really connect with. Vehicles are a giant canvas with plenty of room for creative design, and whether its a wrap with personal significance or one aimed towards promoting a business or brand I appreciate being apart of the process. </p>
